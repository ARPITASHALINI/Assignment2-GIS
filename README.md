# Visualisation and Analysis of NDVI in Bhutan

I chose Bhutan as my country for the analysis. The NDVI is a dimensionless index that describes the difference between visible and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation cover and can be used to estimate the density of green on an area of land (Weier and Herring, 2000). Bhutan has often been regarded as the greenest country in the world. One of Bhutan's significant natural resources in the late twentieth century was its rich forests and natural vegetation. We can observe great mountainious regions in the north and high vegetation regions in the middle of the country ranging to the southern part.
